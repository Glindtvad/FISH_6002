Summary: Dataset contains the annual survey data from the ICES NS-IBTS, collaborated between 8 countries for the years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020. 
	 Data is a compilation of three datasets of the hauling information, overall catches and detailed by species.
	 Hauling data includes information such as location, time, year and physical information of the trawling gear and the deployment of it.
	 Overall catch data includes area, time and trawl data and catch data such as species, total numbers, total weight, measured numbers, subtotal weight and individual lengths.

Variables:

RecordType - The field consists of a 2-character code, which defines the record type and thus the layout of the data fields included on that record. Codes are as follows: HH - Haul Information, HL - Length Frequency Distribution, CA - SMALKS.

DataType - Code that specifies the data type for a number of fields in HL-record. C - TotalNo and CatCatchWgt are adjusted per hour of hauling; R and S - raw data as recorded during the cruise. S should be applied only if whole catch was sub-sampled, so SubFactor for the hole is > 1.
